# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This is a work day calender, with this app you are able to put in your schedule for the day and save it and it will stay there even when the page is refreshed. With this as well if you have passed the hour of the day it is that slot will turn grey, if it is currently the hour it will be red, and if it is passed the hour it will be green. Along with all these things the program for me was one of the ones that made sense. After a lot of code review and help to get the first little bit done and the javascript it all was just kinda repeating the proccess.
